# Data Science Toolbox Assessment 0

This is the first project, where we have done Exploratory Data Analysis for Cricket data, which was found using the $\texttt{cricketdata}$ package.

# README.md

## Project Group

* Elliot M
* Daniel M
* Youssef O
* Leo B
* James M

This project is equally split betwen the five project partners.

## Reading order and requirements

All report content is in the directory:

* report/

The report takes the following structure:

* 01-Data.Rmd
* 02-R_analysis.Rmd
* 03-Python_Analysis.ipynb
* 04-Wrapup.Rmd

With html output of the Rmd content included for convenience.

### Requirements:

Requirements for the Rmd files are given within each script, or can be installed in advance using:
```{sh}
Rscript requirementsR.R
```
in which the list of packages used is given.

Requirements for the Python code is given in `requirements.txt`; to install, in a virtual environment run:

```{sh}
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Evidence

Our working is shown in our own directories,

* RachelR/test.Rmd
* PeterP/work.ipynb

Rachel R wrote the R analysis, Peter P wrote the Python analysis, and we wrote the Data processing and wrapup together after examination of the whole analysis.

## Reflections

We have placed our reflections in the folder:

* reflection/
  - RachelR_Reflection.pdf
  - PeterP_Reflection.pdf

Thanks!
